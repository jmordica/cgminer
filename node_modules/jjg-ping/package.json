Latency should have a value.\n            console.log('Google is reachable (' + latency + ' ms ping).');\n        }\n        else {\n            // Host is down. Latency should be 0.\n            console.log('Google is unreachable.');\n        }\n    });\n\n## Why jjg-ping?\n\nBecause npm [doesn't support namespacing](https://npmjs.org/doc/faq.html#Why-no-namespaces), and ping, node-ping, and all the other namespaces I wanted were already taken.\n\n## License\n\nJJG Ping is licensed under the MIT (Expat) license. See included LICENSE.md.\n",
